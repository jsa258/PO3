    <h2>BIO</h2>
    <p>My name is Jenny Situ and I am a third-year SFU student majoring in the Interactive Arts and Technology program. I have a passion for art and the inspiration for my artworks and design ideas reflect my personal experiences, background, and
      values. I believe that design is a form of language allowing artists to its audience through different forms of medium. Throughout my studies, I have been introduced to different forms of design techniques which has slowly influence my interest
      in design and technology. I aspire to pursue a career as a UX designer and participate in designing future innovations.</p>

  <section class="ProjectOne">
    <h2>PROJECT 1: INFORMATION DESIGN</h2>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>In my information design class, I worked in a group of 3 to design an informative website that addresses the environmental issue of desertification in China. Good teamwork, performance, and management allowed our team to deliver a successful
      final product to our audience.</p>

    <div class="Description">
      <h2>Stages</h2>
      <p>The first stages of creating this project were brainstorming topics and research. During the first meeting, we discussed each other’s interests to come up with an idea and who our target audience was. We divided the project into three main
        roles which were: illustrator, web developer, and writer. Afterward, we individually took upon a role based on our strengths and did research. During each meeting, we discussed, make changes and began building a prototype.</p>
      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p> I was responsible for writing the website content. The greatest challenge for me was selecting the most crucial information for our audience and writing the content through an formal approach. First, I began by researching all the essential
        information and organize into different sections using a mind map. The most difficult encounters were representing the facts in a creative and organized narrative. I learned from the professor that is is crucial for an informative website to
        establish a narrative that draws the audience’s attention throughout the website. To overcome this issue, I did extensive research on different data types and methods to present information. We eventually proposed the idea of including
        interactive illustrations, and diagrams to generate sn interest from the audience and promote an easier read and understanding.</p>
      <h2>Success</h2>
      <p>The biggest factor in our success was great teamwork and management. Our group respected each other’s opinions and worked together and assist each other out with any difficulties we encountered to put together the final website. As well, we
        were organized and scheduled meetings and deadlines for ourselves to ensure we were efficiently using our time. </p>

  <section class="ProjectTwo">
    <h2>PROJECT 2: MAGAZINE</h2>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Working as a group of 3, we designed a magazine on the topic of Samoyeds. This project reflects my graphic design and photoshop skills</p>
    <h2>Evaluation</h2>
    <p>Evaluation: Working as a team, I learned about the importance of being open minded to new ideas and having good communication with the members to work effectively. The main difficulty of working in a group rather than individually I learned is
      that, meeting deadlines and accomplishing your part of the work on time is very important for efficiency. For the first stage of the process, because I did not finish on time, the entire process was delayed which made our teamwork less
      productive. </p>
