      <p class="description" data-aos="zoom-in">The first stages of creating this project were brainstorming topics and research. During the first meeting, we discussed each other’s interests to come up with an idea and who our target audience was.
        We divided the project into three main roles which were: illustrator, web developer, and writer. Afterward, we individually took upon a role based on our strengths and did research. During each meeting, we discussed,
        make changes and began building a prototype.</p>
