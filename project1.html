    <div class="Concept-child">
      <p class="description" data-aos="zoom-in">The first stages of creating this project was brainstorming and research. As a group, we discussed each other’s interests to come up with an idea on who our target audience was. We established our
        audience through discussing stakeholders and personas so we can continue to act in the best interests of the target audience moving forward We divided the project into three main roles which were: illustrator, web developer, and writer and I
        took on the role of the illustrator. </p>

      <h1 class="title" data-aos="zoom-in">PROGRESS</h1>
      <p class="description" data-aos="zoom-in">The first step of development is to create frameworks and layouts of the website. I created a flow chart of the breakdown of the website and categorized each section that would create good user
        experience when browsing through the flow of information. In addition, we designed potential web layouts to analyze how to place each element within each page so we are all clear as a group.</p>

      <p class="description" data-aos="zoom-in">With an abundance of information we wanted to convey to our audience, the challenge was to present this information through graphics so that is easier and more attractive for audience to understand. For
        statistics, we utilize information graphs and implemented other design methods that will be able to tell a story or inform an audience without having to read text.</p>

      <p class="description" data-aos="zoom-in">As I took upon the illustrator rule, the goal is for audience to understand information through graphics. I used illustrator and photoshop to design a scenery to highlight the main issues that people
        were facing within that environment. </p>

      <p class="description" data-aos="zoom-in">The most difficult encounter was selecting the most crucial information and representing the facts in a creative and organized narrative. The biggest factor in our success was great teamwork and
        management. Our group respected each other’s opinions and worked together and assist each other out with any difficulties we encountered to put
        together the final website. As well, we were organized and scheduled meetings and deadlines for ourselves to ensure we were efficiently using our time.</p>
